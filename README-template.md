## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS


### What I learned

In this challenges I used CSS Pre-processor SASS to make the component. It was a simple project but it helped me to practice variables and nesting.


If you want more help using SASS, I'd recommend checking out [SASS Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide) to learn more.


### Continued development

In future projects I will focus on adding Mixins and modules on SASS to make it more simple.
